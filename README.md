## Picture Social - Episode 1
Talking about Containers in software architecture and development is unavoidable. Some of us are already working with this concepts while others are just starting the path, either way I would like to be your buddy in this journey that starts with a hypothetical scenario of making a Picture Social Media solution that will face challenges that we are going to work together in a series of episodes.

This first episode is about containerizing an API developed in C# using .NET 6 that returns the text passed as parameter. We are going to containerize this application because we don’t want to change recipes, scripts and dependencies when we go from local to cloud environments or viceversa and we want to maintain consistency across changes in the app that affect the subjacent platform so we’ll version OS Structure, OS Libraries, Application Server, Runtime and Application Code at the same time.
