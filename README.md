## Picturesocial

Picturesocial is a new content series that will include code samples, blogs, and videos. Itâ€™s based on a hypothetical social media network for sharing pictures. The main use case is that user can post pictures and the app will use AI to caption and tag them. Sentiment analysis is used to add "reactions" to pictures based on the comments. The content will start with the basics of the selected technologies and cover potential challenges with a release to production.
